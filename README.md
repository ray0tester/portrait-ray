🎵 Lyric Image Mask Project
This project uses HTML and CSS to create a visual effect where an image is masked inside a block of text (like song lyrics).

🚀 Getting Started
1. File Setup
Ensure you have two files in the same folder:

index.html

main.css

2. Prepare Your Image
Find a high-contrast image (bright colors work best against the black background).

Place the image in your project folder or have the URL ready.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation
Step 1: Add Your Lyrics
Open index.html. Replace the comment `` with your chosen lyrics.

Tip: For the best effect, use a lot of text. Copy and paste the chorus multiple times if needed to fill the screen!

Step 2: Link Your Image
Open main.css. Find the line: background: url("INSERT YOUR IMAGE HERE") no-repeat center;

Replace INSERT YOUR IMAGE HERE with your filename (e.g., wallpaper.jpg) or a direct image link.

Step 3: Adjust the Typography (Optional)
In main.css, you can tweak the p tag settings to change the "density" of the mask:

font-size: Smaller text (like the current 12px) makes the image look more detailed.

line-height: Lowering this (currently 8px) makes the lines overlap or sit closer, showing more of the image.
